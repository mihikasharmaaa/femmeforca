<!-- Introduction giving an overview of the overall purpose of the organization -->
  <p style="padding-left:30px; padding-right:30px; font-size:30; margin:0">To efficiently and effectively organize our
        efforts, we group our events into four categories: Advocacy, Awareness, Fundraising, and Service. In this way,
        we are able to increase membership by catering to the interests of all while serving the community in as many
        ways possible.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align:center;">Advocacy</h3>
        <p>We have noted at least 16 laws still present in various state constitutions that discriminate on the basis of sex. To list a few:
        <ul style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; padding-bottom:0px;">
          <li>Men cannot 'seduce corrupt single women' in Michigan.</li>
          <li>Married women require permission from their husbands in order to get haircuts in Michigan.</li>
          <li>The luxury tax on female hygiene products still exists in 40 states.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="padding-top:0;">There is no reason to have them present in any legal documents, regardless of whether they are being enforced or not. To address this, we facilitate legal action. Each month, we hold events in a community room. Community members can  write letters to Congress asking them to address the issue, and we send them after every session. Through this process, we are both raising awareness and taking targeted action.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm">
        <br>
        <h3 style="text-align:center;">Awareness</h3>
        <p>At Femme Forca, we hope to not only keep each other accountable, but do so for the future generations as well. We hope to teach children how to avoid biases from a young age, and do so through our advocacy program. We hold monthly assemblies with elementary schools in the town we are based out of in order to create growth mindsets early on.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm">
        <br>
        <h3 style="text-align:center;">Fundraising</h3>
        <p>As a smaller organization, we recognize that an effective way of impacting positive change is through fundraising for large nonprofits. Through a variety of restaurant fundraisers, bake sales, and a movie night held in a local town, we were able to generate just above $3,500. This went directly to supporting the Tri-Valley Haven, an organizations that aids women and children who have been victims of abuse. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm">
        <br>
        <h3 style="text-align:center;">Service</h3>
        <p>In order to aid in efforts made by larger organizations, we plan to volunteer as groups to provide our service to those who need it. These have included the Tri-Valley Haven organization, partnernships with the UN's GirlUp organization, GirlsWhoCode, and more.</p>
