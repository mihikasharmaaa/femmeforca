    <h4>Journal Entry: Final Fundraiser for the Tri-Valley Haven, Bake Sale, 07/02/2019</h4>
    <p>Sweet aromas wafted through the kitchen, giving away what we planned to sell during our fundraiser. We'd baked trays of brownies, decorated dozens of cupcakes, and packaged boxes of cookies. We would joke to ease our nerves, but we all hoped the fundraiser would do well. Ally, one of our board members, came up with the idea to execute a door-to-door fundraiser, taking it back to the old days. We'd seen the challenges presented by fundraisers done through fliers, at restaurants that take a portion of profits, and street corners where it's easy to be ignored. We took a risk – choosing door-to-door fundraising because of its direct, personal approach.</p>
    <p>The following morning, we loaded into each other's cars to hit as many neighborhoods as possible. Gathering the courage to ask someone for help was daunting, but it led to a more personal connection with the donors when we were able to personally explain our cause.</p>
    <p>We'd partnered with the Tri-Valley Haven before, and had seen the results of our efforts. As an organization that aids women and children who are victims of domestic abuse, they paid for food to support the safe homes they created, advocates for victims in the hospital, and awareness programs to stop the problem at its source. The $834.00 we generated through this effort went directly to aiding all of these initiatives.</p>
    <p>Thanks to Ally, we were able to try something new – and it proved to be more successful than our past fundraising endeavors. We created personal connections with members of our local community, and were able to get even more people interested in our nonprofit. We have ten new members signed up to come to the next Congressional Letter Writing Event, and have more support for those who need it.</p>
